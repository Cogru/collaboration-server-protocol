# collaboration-server-protocol

`collaboration-server-protocol` (CSP) is the analog to [language-server-protocol][]

For all requests, the field `method` is always **required**.

    "method": "login",
    "username": "my-name",
    "email": "my.email@example.com",
    "password": "XXXXXX",
}
```

- `username` and `email`; one must required and one must be empty string.

{
    "method": "logout",
